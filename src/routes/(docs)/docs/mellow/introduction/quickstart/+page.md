## Prerequisites
1. The `Administrator` permission in your desired Discord server.
2. A [HAKUMI Account](/sign-up) with a Discord [connection](/docs/platform/account/connections).

## Add to your server
Before you do anything, you'll need mellow in your server... fancy an [invite link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1068554282481229885)?

## Set it all up!
Execute the `/setup` slash command in Discord to get started, it's so very simple!

You should have received a successful result (hurray!) along with a handy-dandy link to your server's dashboard!
###### for reference, you can also find your server [here](/mellow/servers).

## Initiation complete!
Assuming all has gone well, you have successfully set up mellow, and are now ready for what lies ahead!
